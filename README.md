Analyzing United Airlines Flights from NYC: Efficiency & Gain Insights


Overview:

This project explores the time efficiency of United Airlines (UA) flights departing from New York City using the nycflights13 dataset. The main objective is to quantify gain per flight — the time recovered or lost — using exploratory data analysis, hypothesis testing, and confidence intervals.


Objectives:

- Analyze the difference in net gain for flights that departed on time vs. late.

- Identify the top 5 destination airports for UA flights and compare gain distributions.

- Calculate gain per hour for late vs. on-time, very late vs. not very late, and short vs. long flights.

- Use statistical inference (t-tests, CIs) to validate findings.


Methods:

- Data Wrangling & Feature Engineering (e.g., net_gain, gain_per_hour)

- Visualizations (boxplots, bar plots)

- Confidence Intervals & Hypothesis Testing

- Group-wise Comparisons (late vs. on-time, flight duration groups)


Key Insights:

- Significant gain differences were observed between late and on-time departures.

- Shorter flights showed significantly higher average gain per hour compared to longer ones.

- Top destinations like SFO and ORD had the highest average gain, but CIs overlapped.


Tools Used:

- R, tidyverse, nycflights13

- Statistical analysis using t.test()
- Visualizations using ggplot2
